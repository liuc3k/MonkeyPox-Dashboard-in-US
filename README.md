## Introduction

The purpose of this R shiny application is going to allow US residents to track monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases via interactive map and statistical plots.

## Summary

*  This <b>R-shiny</b> application focuses on producing a chronograph map and a time series plot to visualize monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States (US) as a web application, developed using the <b>Shiny</b> and <b>Leaflet</b> library in R.
